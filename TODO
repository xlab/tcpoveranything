The biggie is modifying the packet protocol so that the userspace
client can feed back PMTU information to tcpoveranything. Combined
with setting the tun interface MTU really high (say, 20k),
tcpoveranything can send the appropriate ICMPv6 chatter to make the
kernel adjust the size of its TCP segments.

Right now, we just simplify and cap the MTU at the IPv6 minimum (1280
bytes). That produces packets that are at most 1236 bytes. While in
theory ipv4 can have lower MTUs, in practice, anything below 1400
bytes is unusual, which leaves quite a bit of headroom for your own
encapsulation.
